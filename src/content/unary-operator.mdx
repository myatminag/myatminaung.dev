### What is unary operator?

The last operator of our arithmetic operators is unary operator. An unary operator stands out as it opreates on
a single opreand, either before or after it. This opreand can be variable, constant or expression. Unary operators
are commonly used for tasks like incrementing or decrementing numeric values, negating expression, converting data
types and more.

### Increment and Decrement

```js
// Increment
let num1 = 1;
num1++;

console.log('num1', num1); // Output: 2

// Decrement
let num2 = 2;
num2--;

console.log('num2', num2); // Output: 1
```

The increment operator `++` increments its opreand by 1, while the decrement operator `--` decrements its
operand by 1.

### Prefix and Postfix

```js
let x = 3;
console.log('x', ++x); // Output: 4
```

If we have the increment operator `++` before its operand, it returns the updated value. It means that prefix
gets executed value before sending the variable though.

```js
let x = 5;
console.log('x', x--); // Output: 5
console.log('x', x); // Output: 4
```

Similarly, the postfix decrement operator `x--` subtracts 1 from its operand but returns the original value of
the operand before it was decremented.

### Logical Negation

```js
let isTrue = false;
console.log('isTrue', !isTrue); // Output: true
```

The logical negation operator `!` reverses the truthiness of its operand. If the operand is `falsy`, it
returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Typeof Operator

```js
let value = 10;
console.log('value', typeof value); // Output: number
```

The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.
