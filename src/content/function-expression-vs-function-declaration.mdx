When you're working with JavaScript, It is essential to understand the different
ways of defining functions. Among them, we will explore the differences
between **Function Expression** and **Function Declaration** in this article.

### Function Expression

A function expression refers to the act of assigning a function to a variable. It also
creates an anonymous function due to the absence of function name. Here's an example
of a function expression.

```js
const sum = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

**Note**: let, const or var can be used to declare a variable.

In this example, we assign an anonymous function to the variable **sum**. Function
expression are often used when we need to pass a function as an argument to another function
or when we want to assign a function to a property of an object.

### Function Declaration

A function declaration in JavaScript is a straightforward way to define a function.
It starts with the **function** keyword followed by the name of the function. It's used
to define a function that can be invoked later in the code.

```js
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

In this example, we define a named function **multiply** that can be called later in the code.
Function declarations are commonly used when we want to define utility functions or when we
want to create functions that are accessible throughout the entire scope.

### Hoisting: Declaration vs Expression

Hoisting means the principle of moving declarations of variables, functions or classes to the top
of the scope in which they are defined. One crucial difference between function declaration vs function
expression is hoisting.

```js
// Function Declaration
multiply(2, 2);

function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

// Function Expression
sum(2, 3);

const sum = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

Function Declaration are hoisted to the top of their containing scope. In the example,
our function **multiply** can be used before the actual declaration in this code due to the hositing.
However, attempting to call the function expression before its assignement results in
`ReferenceError: sum is not defined`.

So, understanding differences between function expression and function declaration is crucial for
writing clean and maintainable JavaScript code.
