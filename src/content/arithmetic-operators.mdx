### What are Operators?

In the realm of JavaScript programming, operators play a pivotal role in manipulating variables, performing
calculations and making comparisons. These operators are building blocks of any JavaScript code,
enabling developers to perform various tasks efficiently. Before we are going to explore operators, It's
essential to understand the concepts of operands and operators.

### Operands

They are the values to perform operations. They can be literals, variables or expressions. For instance, \
in this expression `x + y` , `x` and `y` are the operands and `+` is the operator.

### Operators

They are the actions or the instructions that modify, perform calculations or compare on values or
variables (also known as operands). These actions can range from simple addition operations to complex logical operations.
There are various types of operators such as arithmethic operators, assignment operators,
comparison operators, logical operators, ternary operators and others. In this article, we are going to talk about
arithmethic operators.

### Addition

The addition operator in JavaScript is not quite simple. We use `+` operator for both numeric operation and string
concatenation.

> Numeric Addition

```js
const num1 = 10;
const num2 = 20;

const total = num1 + num2;

console.log('total', total); // output: 30
```

The most common use case for the addition operator is performing arithmetic addition on numeric values.

> String Concatenation

```js
const str1 = 'Hello ';
const str2 = 'World';

const result = str1 + str2;

console.log('result', result); // output: 'Hello World'
```

When one or both operands are the strings, instead of performing addition, the `+` operator concatenate the strings
together.

> Implicit Type Conversion

```js
const num = 2;
const str = '3';

const result = num + str;

console.log('result', result); // output: "23"
```

As we already knew that JavaScipt is dynamically typed language, which means that the variables can hold values of any
data type. Adding values of different data types may perform implicit type conversion to coerce the operands into compatible
format.

### Subtraction

```js
const num1 = 10;
const num2 = 5;

const result = num1 - num2;

console.log('result', result); // output: 5;
```

Substraction works as we would expect. We use `-` for this operation. If we subtract a number and a string, the result
will be `NaN`.

### Multiplication

```js
const num1 = 2;
const num2 = 2;

const result = num1 * num2;

console.log('result', result); // output: 4;
```

Multiplication in JavaScript is performed using the `*` operator. However, we cannot multiply a number and
a string in JavaScript and the result of multiplying a numeric and non-numeric value is `NaN`.

### Division Operator

```js
const num1 = 10;
const num2 = 2;

const result = num1 / num2;

console.log('result', result); // output: 5;
```

The division operator `/` in JavaScript is used to divide one numeric value by another.

### Exponentiation

```js
const num1 = 3;
const num2 = 2;

const result = num1 ** num2;

console.log('result', result); // output: 9;
```

Exponentiation is the process of raising the base number to the power of another. It can be read as `x` to
the power of `y`. We use `**` for this operator in JavaScipt.

### Modulus

```js
const num1 = 11;
const num2 = 2;

const result = num1 % num2;

console.log('result', result); // output: 1;
```

Modulus is the operation which determines the remainder when one number is divided by another. The character we use
for this operation is `%` .
