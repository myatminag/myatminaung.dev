Next.js provides a powerful routing system that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web
applications with ease. The essential feature of web applications is the ability to handle search queries
through URL parameters. In this article, we'll explore how to implement URL search params in next.js app router
with react query.

### 1. Importing necessary modules

```tsx
'use client';

import { usePathname, useSearchParams, useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { useDebouncedCallback } from 'use-debounce';
import axios from 'axios';
```

Firstly, we need to declare `'use client'` at the top the component. We import some necessary Next.js hooks
from `'next/navigation'`. `useQuery` is imported from [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview)
that is a powerful library for managing and caching asynchronous data in React applications.
`useDebouncedCallback` is imported from the [use-debounce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-debounce)
module. This utility is commonly used in React applications to debounce callback functions. Then **axios** is
imported

### 2. Initialize hooks

```tsx
const router = useRouter();
const pathname = usePathname();
const searchParams = useSearchParams();
```

- `useRouter()` gives access Next.js router object to change routes within client components.
- `usePathname()` provides the current pathname of the URL.
- `useSearchParams()` accesses and interacts with parameters from the URL.

### 3. Handling search action

```tsx
const handleSearchUsername = useDebouncedCallback((term: string) => {
  const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
  if (term) {
    params.set('q', term);
  } else {
    params.delete('q');
  }
  router.replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
}, 300);
```

In this example, `handleSearchUsername` function is integrated with `useDebouncedCallback` function that ensures
a function is only called after a certain delay (300 milliseconds) without being invoked repeatly. Inside the
callback function, it creates a new `URLSearchParams` object from existing parameters.

If the search term (term) is provided, it sets the 'q' parameter to the search term; otherwise, it deletes the
'q' parameter. Then, it replaces the current URL with the modified search parameters using `router.replace()`,
for updating the URL without a full page reload.

### 4. Search input integration

```tsx
<input
  type="text"
  placeholder="Search username..."
  defaultValue={searchParams.get('q')?.toString()}
  onChange={(e) => handleSearchUsername(e.target.value)}
/>
```

Later, The `onChange` handler triggers `handleSearchUsername` with the new search term, updating the URL accordingly.
Here `defaultValue` is used to set the initial value of the input field based on the 'q' parameter in the URL.

If the user had previously entered a search query and then refreshed the page, the input field will still display
the value they entered due to the `defaultValue` attribute. This provides a smoother and more user-friendly experience, as users don't lose their entered data when refreshing the page.

### 5. Integrating with react query

```tsx
const query = searchParams.get('q');

const { data, isLoading, isError } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['users', query] as const,
  queryFn: async () => {
    return await axios
      .get('/users', {
        params: {
          query,
        },
      })
      .then((res) => res.data);
  },
});
```

Finally, we'll integrate our search functionality with React Query to fetch and cache search results efficiently.
we retrieve the value of the `'q'` parameter from the URL using `searchParams.get('q')`.
This parameter will be used as part of the query key in React Query to ensure that each unique search query
results in a separate cache entry.

We use `useQuery` hook from React Query to fetch the search results. The `queryKey` property is set to \
`['users', query]` where query is the search term obtained from the URL. This array is used as a unique identifier
for the query in the cache. Whenever the search query changes, React Query will automatically refetch the data
and update the cache accordingly.

The `queryFn` property is an asynchronous function that performs the actual data fetching. In this case, we're
using axios to make a GET request to the '/users' endpoint with the search query as a parameter.

By integrating our search functionality with React Query, we benefit from features such as automatic caching,
stale-while-revalidate, and automatic refetching. This allows us to provide a smooth and responsive user
experience while efficiently managing data fetching and caching in our Next.js application.
